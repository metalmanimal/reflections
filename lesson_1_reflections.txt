How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

The first version was fine while the second version wasn't.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

If you needed to revert to an old version for some reason, you wouldn't have
to re-code that version. You could just swap back to that saved version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically save, like Google
Docs does?

Manually choosing when to commit allows for logical checkpoints between commits
The downside is that you must remember to do them. Automatically having
version saved doesn't require you to remember to do it, but the versions will
certainly end up being illogical at some point.
